    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating the value of a population parameter based on sample data. In other words, it involves making inferences about a population based on a sample taken from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of estimation in statistics: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimation:\n",
    "Point estimation involves using a single value, called a point estimate, to approximate the unknown value of a population parameter. The point estimate is typically calculated from sample data and provides an estimate of the most likely value of the population parameter. For example, if we are interested in estimating the average height of students in a school, we can take a random sample of students and calculate the sample mean. This sample mean would be our point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimation:\n",
    "Interval estimation involves using a range of values, called a confidence interval, to estimate the unknown value of a population parameter. The confidence interval is calculated from sample data and provides a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. For example, if we are interested in estimating the average height of students in a school with a 95% confidence interval, we can calculate the sample mean and then calculate a range of values around this mean that is likely to contain the population mean with a 95% level of confidence. This range of values would be our interval estimate of the population mean.\n",
